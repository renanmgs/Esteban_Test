# upworkestebantest

This is the project for a job in Upwork.

Awnsers:
1 - Flutter has 3 build modes: Debug, Profile and Reselase.
2 - One of the most used types of tests uses the tester class with pump, tap, and any another user interactions with an expect condition later, so you can simulate user ordered interactions.
3 - Stateless Widgets are widgets that uses static or non-changable information, they are lightweight and fast. StatefullWidget is a little more heavy to handle but can change its contents and update what is shown in the screen.
4 - Is a location reference for something in the widget tree.
5 - BloC is a type of structure that helps with data injection trough widgets in a ordered and reusable way.
6 - It represents that a variable can have a nullable value, so you can check the null-deference in compile time.
7 - It is a representation that a variable will have its value *later*, it does not initilize on declaration.
8 - Async is an asyncronous function, it does not run on the main processor thread, helps with heavy operations that can freeze your device. Await is just a way to tell the routine to wait for an async operation to finish.
9 - It is a way to declare that this piece of information is immutable.
10 - Keys are the personal ID of a widget, every widget has its own ID and you can use that ID to keep tha widget state across builds.
11 - Navigator is a stack of routes and it handles *navigation* across the app pages.
12 - Var is for simple dynamic declaration of a variable type. Dart will replace it with the value type. Final need to be used when you need to inject and maintain that value in a variable.
13 - Equatable helps to avoid boilerplate. If you dont use it, you can have duplicate calls and everyone of them will rebuild the widget.
14 - Only in GameDevelopment, the concept is the same with streams and observers.
15 - Yes, most with the default setState and a little with Provider
16 - SOLID is an acronym that help programmers to remember good practices in programming.
